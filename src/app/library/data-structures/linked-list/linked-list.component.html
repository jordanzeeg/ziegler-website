<p>linked-list works!</p>
<div class = "workspace">
    <h2 class = "theme-style">Linked List</h2>
    <p>
        Linked Lists are a data structure where rather than setting them into an array with fixed length it simply includes a reference to the next element in the List.
        This particular one has functions that allow for adding elements to the front, adding them to the back, and removing from those locations. 
        This is similar functionality to data structures known as queues or stacks, which is where linked lists really shine.
