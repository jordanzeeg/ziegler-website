<div class = "theme-style2">
    <h2 class="align-center">Completions</h2>
    <p>This is where the completed programs live. check them out by choosing a desired program from the left. 
        This area will probably not be updated very much because programmers are like writers, in that it is very difficult to look at code projects and say they are done.
    There's always a better way, or an added feature that would be nice to have. Especially as one grows and develops in skill it is difficult to look back and be proud of past successes.
