    <p>This is where the automation programs live. check them out by choosing a desired program from the left. 
        This area will probably be updated quickly or slowly but in large increments because I will be writing a lot of automations. 
        After the conclusion of the development of this website, my next task was to work on automations following automatetheboringstuff.com
        The nice thing about these projects is that they are useful to me in some way. The downside of automations is that often they are person specific.
        For example the first program in here is a program that uploads to git. It assumes a great deal about my current settings, like the fact that it doesn't need to check for creds. 
    There's always a better way, or an added feature that would be nice to have. Especially as one grows and develops in skill it is difficult to look back and be proud of past successes.
