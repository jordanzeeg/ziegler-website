    <p>
        As I work on building my 2d Strategy game I started working on procedural generation for the map making.
        Making a map in this way is potentially simplified for me through this method.
        Using this I should be able to make a bunch of map templates to be utilized in randomized ways.

        The actual functionality of wave function collapse is taking an image or tileset and using that to generate new tilesets following the same patterns.
        This page is serving as my demo production before I implement it in the game design area. 
        The tutorial I'm following is built in javascript.
