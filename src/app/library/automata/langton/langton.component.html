    <p>
        Langton's ant is another cellular automata. 
        What's cool about this one is that given infinite space it devolves into a set pattern which is somewhat interesting. 
        It was developed in 1986 by Chris Langton. It's another clever program I was inspired to work on from The Coding Train on youtube.
