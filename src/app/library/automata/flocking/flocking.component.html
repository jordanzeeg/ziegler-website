        One of my goals in life is to build a 2d turn based strategy game, 
        and so there are a lot of concepts related to that which I have an interest in because I know they will be helpful when I work on that project. 
        The boids algorithm, designed by Craig Reynolds in 1986,
        is one of those concepts because it provides an option for AI units to be controlled while still providing for somewhat natural movements and flow. 
        I was again introduced to this concept by The Coding Train.
