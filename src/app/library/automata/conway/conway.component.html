    <p>
        Conway's game of life is a clever program that was developed in 1970 by John Conway. 
        It's a pretty clever program I was inspired to work on from The Coding Train on youtube. 
        I love doing cool graphics and I especially enjoyed working on a program utilizing a 2d grid.
