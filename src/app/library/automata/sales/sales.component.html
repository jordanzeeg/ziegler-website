    <p>
        The traveling salesman problem is an interesting one I came across multiple times before finally deciding to code on it. 
        I was again partly inspired by seeing that The Coding Train did a video on it, 
        but also I love the concept of this because a major solution to this problem involved information gathered from observing ant colonies. 
        One of the things that's always fascinating to me is when we can learn complex systems and solutions from nature and the creatures around us. 
        I learned in school that this ant colony optimization was integral in the development of cellular phones which is pretty fascinating. 
        In this particular page I showcase multiple different solutions to the problem.

    this first one is a brute force approach that just checks options randomly to see if it's better. recorded distance = {{recordDistance}}
