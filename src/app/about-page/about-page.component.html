	<h1 class = "align-center">About Jordan Ziegler</h1>
	<p>I am a software developer with experience in the full stack development of a web application. I graduated from California
	Baptist University with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have created dynamic front-end applications
	using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Bootstrap, and TypeScript. In fact, you are reading one of these applications right now. 
	 In addition, I have created applications that utilize Servlets and Spring to transfer
	data from the front end to the back end. I have worked with Node.js to perform API calls to python programs.  I have used SQL, Hibernate, and Spring Data to manage data in an Oracle
	database. In short, I've worked on a lot of things, and I feel the need to put them all in one place. This website will serve as a resume with code examples. 
	In college when we were working on the MicroMouse competition, we talked about how other colleges had programming libraries 
	with functions their students could draw from and use to build their future projects and programs. 
	I felt like it would be important to myself and others to create one of those, and I will use this as my medium. </p>

	<h5 >Application Developer at HCL</h5>
	<p >While working for HCL I was contracted to work for Intel on their Technology Leadership Marketing Team. On this team I was tasked with developing 
		projects that would provide as showcases or simulations of progress on various technologies Intel was working on. I updated a demo about a program known as Control Flag 
		using TouchDesigner which I had learned to use on the job. 
		Following that I worked on a project showcasing the benefits of a security device in the usage of speech recognition applications.  
		I updated a UI program in TouchDesigner that showcased a program called ControlFlag utilizing data from a log file to demonstrate the functionality of the program. 
		Shortly thereafter I began working on a program to showcase security features through a speech recognition program that simulates federated learning. 
		I developed from scratch the angular UI that calls to a node.js server for speech recognition data. 
		This UI in addition to accepting audio data for speech recognition purposes uses 
		threejs, a javascript library, to provide a 3-dimensional graphic interpretation of how federated learning works amidst the security protections. 
		I found and implemented for this purpose a trainable open source machine learning model which I got working, updated, and trained to provide more accurate results to the UI.
