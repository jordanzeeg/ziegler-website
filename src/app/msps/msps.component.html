      <p>The goal of this project was to create a portable power station made out of aluminum and steel in order to supply power to people outdoors and in incliment weather. The ideal deployment includes wheels and a lightweight structure that allows for easy maneuvering and transport as well as solar panels for charging, a battery for storage of energy from the solar panels, and the ability to use common electrical plugs for ease of use. </p>
